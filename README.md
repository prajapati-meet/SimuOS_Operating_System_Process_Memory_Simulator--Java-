#  SimuOS – Operating System Process & Memory Simulator (Java)


#  Overview

SimuOS is a Java-based simulation of core Operating System components designed to 
demonstrate Object-Oriented Design and Design Pattern implementation.

This System simulates : 

  - Process creation & lifecycle management
  - CPU scheduling algorithms
  - Memory allocation management
  - File system hierarchy
  - Resource monitoring

The project focuses on clean architecture, modular design, and design pattern
integration using pure Java.


# Tech Stack

  - Java
  - Object-Oriented Programming(OOPs) Concepts
  - Design Patterns 
  - Eclipse IDE
  - Github


# Key Features with Design Pattern :

  - Singleton – Kernel :
    Ensures only one OS kernel instance exists.
    
  - Factory – ProcessFactory :
    Encapsulates process creation logic.
    
  - State – Process Lifecycle :
    Encapsulates behavior for:
        -1) Ready
        -2) Running
        -3) Waiting
        -4) Terminated
    Removes conditional state handling.
    
  - Strategy – Scheduler :
    Allows switching between:
        -1) FCFS
        -2) Round Robin
    Without modifying Process class.
    
  - Observer – Resource Monitoring :
    Notifies CPU and Memory observers when:
        -1)State changes
        -2)Memory Allocation occurs

  - Composite – File System :
    Represents hierarchical structure of:
        1) Directories
        2) Files
    Uniform interface for both.
    
  - Flyweight – Memory Blocks :
    Reuses memory blocks of same size to reduce object creation.
    
  - Iterator – Process Traversal :
    Custom iterator for process queue.


#  Learning Outcomes

This project helped in understanding:

  - Operating System concepts (process scheduling, memory allocation)
  - Practical implementation of multiple design patterns in a single architecture
  - Modular project structuring using packages
  - Clean Object-Oriented system design
  - Git version control and project documentation
